today I want to confess something to you

but first of all I'm going to ask you a

couple of questions how many people here

have children and how many of you are

confident that you know how to bring up

your children in exactly the right way

okay I don't see too many hands going up

on that second one and that's my

confession too I've got three boys

they're three nine and twelve and like

you and like most parents the honest

truth is I have pretty much no idea what

I'm doing I know I want them to be happy

and healthy in their lives but I don't

really know what I'm supposed to do to

make sure that they are happy and

healthy I mean there's so many books out

there offering all kinds of conflicting

advice it can be really overwhelming so

I've spent most of their lives just

making it up as I go along however

something changed me a few years ago

when I came across a little secret that

we haven't written it's helped me become

more confident about how I bring up my

own children and it's revealed a lot

about how we as a society can help all

children I want to share that secret

with you today for the last 70 years

scientists and Britain have been

following thousands and thousands of

children through their lives as part of

an incredible scientific study there's

nothing quite like it anywhere else in

the world collecting information on

thousands of children is a really

powerful thing to do because it means we

can compare the ones who say do well at

school or end up happy or healthy or

wealthy as adults and the ones who

struggle much more and then we can sift

through all the information we've

collected and try to work out why their

lives turned out different this British

study it's actually a kind of crazy

story so it all starts back in 1946 just

a few months after the end of the war

when scientists wanted to know what it

was like for women to have a baby at the

time they carried out this huge survey

of mothers and ended up recording the

birth of nearly every baby born in

England Scotland and Wales in one week

that was nearly 14 thousand babies the

questions they asked these women back

then are very different than the ones we

might ask today they sound really

old-fashioned now they ask them things

like during pregnancy did

get your full extra ration of a pint of

milk a day how much did you spend on

smokes corsets night dresses knickers

and brassieres and this is my favorite

one who looked after your husband while

you were in bed with this baby now this

war time study actually ended up being

so successful that scientists did it

again they recorded the births of

thousands of babies born in 1958 and

thousands more in 1970 they did it again

in the early 1990s and again at the turn

of the millennium altogether more than

70,000 children have been involved in

these studies across those five

generations they called the British

birth cohorts and scientists have gone

back and recorded more information on

all of these people every few years ever

since the amount of information that's

now being collected on these people is

just completely mind-boggling it

includes thousands of paper

questionnaires and terabytes worth of

computer data scientists have also built

up a huge Bank of tissue samples which

includes locks of hair nail clippings

baby teeth and DNA they've even

collected 9,000 placentas from some of

the births which are now pickled in

plastic buckets in a secure storage

warehouse this whole project has become

unique so no other country in the world

is tracking generations of children in

quite this detail these are some of the

best studied people on the planet and

the data has become incredibly valuable

for scientists generating well over

6,000 academic papers and books but

today I want to focus on just one

finding perhaps the most important

discovery to come from this remarkable

study and it's also the one that spoke

to me personally because it's about how

to use science to do the best for our

children so let's get the bad news out

the way first perhaps the biggest

message from this remarkable study is

this don't be born into poverty and when

to disadvantage because if you are

you're far more likely to walk a

difficult path in life many children in

this study were born into poor families

or into working-class families that had

cramped homes or other problems and it's

clear now

that those disadvantaged children have

been more likely to struggle on almost

every score they've been more likely to

do worse at school to land up with worse

jobs and to earn less money now maybe

that sounds really obvious but some of

the results have been really surprising

so children who had a tough start in

life also more likely to end up

unhealthy as adults they're more likely

to be overweight to have high blood

pressure and then decades down the line

more likely to have a failing memory

poor health and even to die earlier now

I talked about what happens later but

some of these differences emerged to

really shockingly early age in one study

children who were growing up in poverty

were almost a year behind the Richer

children on educational tests and that

was by the age of just three these types

of differences have been found again and

again across the generations it means

that our early circumstances have a

profound influence on the way that the

rest of our lives play out and working

out why that is is one of the most

difficult questions that we face today

so there we have it

first lesson for successful life

everyone is this choose your parents

very carefully don't be born into a poor

family or into a struggling family now

I'm sure you can see the small table

here we can't choose our parents or how

much they earn

but this British study has also struck a

real note of optimism by showing that

not everyone who has a disadvantage

start ends up in difficult circumstances

as you know many people have a tough

start in life but they end up doing very

well on some measure nevertheless and

this study starts to explain how so the

second lesson is this parents really

matter in this study children who had

engaged interested parents once who had

ambition for their future were more

likely to escape from a difficult start

it seems that parents and what they do

are really really important especially

in the first few years of life let me

give you an example of that in one study

scientists looked at about 17,000

children who were born in 1970 they

sifted all the mountains of data that

they had collected to try to work out

what allowed the children who'd had a

difficult start in

I have to go on and do well at school

nevertheless in other words which one's

beat the odds the data showed that what

matters more than anything else was

parents having engaged interested

parents in those first few years of life

were strongly linked to children going

on to do well at school later on in fact

quite small things that parents do are

associated with good outcomes for

children talking and listening to a

child responding to them warmly teaching

them their letters and numbers taking

them on trips and visits reading to

children every day seems to be really

important too so in one study children

whose parents were reading to them daily

when they were 5 and then showing an

interest in their education at the age

of 10 were significantly less likely to

be in poverty at the age of 30 than

those whose parents weren't doing those

things now there are huge challenges

with interpreting this type of science

these studies show that certain things

that parents do are correlated with good

outcomes for children but we don't

necessarily know that those behaviors

cause the good outcomes or whether some

other factor is getting in the way for

example we have to take genes into

account and that's a whole other talk in

itself but scientists working with this

British study are working really hard to

get it causes and this is one study I

particularly love in this one they

looked at the bedtime routines of about

10,000 children born at the turn of the

millennium with the children going to

bed at regular times or did they go to

bed at different times during the week

the data showed that those children who

were going to bed at different times

were more likely to have behavioral

problems and then those that switch to

having regular bedtimes often showed an

improvement in behavior and that was

really crucial because it suggested it

was the bedtime routines that were

really helping things get better for

those kids here's another one to think

about in this one scientists looked at

children who were reading for pleasure

that means that they picked Arthur a

magazine a picture book a storybook the

data showed that children who were

reading for pleasure at the ages of 5

and 10 were more likely to go on and

score better on average on school tests

later in their lives and not just test

of reading but tests of spelling and

maths as well this study really tried to

control for all the confound

factors so it looked at children who

were equally intelligent and came from

the same social class background so it

seemed as if it was the reading which

really helped those children go on and

score better on those school tests later

in their lives now at the start I said

the first lesson from this study it was

not to be born into poverty or into

disadvantage because those children tend

to follow more difficult paths in their

lives but then I said that parenting

matters and that good parenting if you

can call it that helps children beat the

odds and overcome some of those early

disadvantages so wait does that actually

mean then that poverty doesn't matter

after all you could argue it doesn't

matter if a child is born poor as long

as their parents are good parents

they're going to do just fine I don't

believe that's true this study shows

that poverty and parenting matter and

one study actually put figures on that

so it looked at children who are growing

up in persistent poverty and how well

they were doing at school the data

showed that even when their parents were

doing everything right they were putting

me to bed on time reading to them every

day and everything else that only got

those children so far good parenting

only reduced the educational gap between

the rich and poor children by about 50%

now that means that poverty leaves a

really lasting scar and it means that if

we really want to ensure the success and

well-being of the next generation then

tackling child poverty is an incredibly

important thing to do now what does all

this mean for you and me are there

lessons here we can all take home and

use I mean as a scientist and a

journalist I'd like to have some science

to inform my parenting and I can tell

you that when you're shouting at your

kids to go to bed on time it really

helps to have the scientific literature

on your side

I wouldn't it be great to think that all

we had to do to have happy successful

children was to talk to them and be

interested in their future put them to

bed on time and give them a book to read

our job would be done now as you can

imagine the answers are quiet aren't

quite as simple as that

for one thing this study looks what

happens to thousands and thousands of

children on average but that doesn't

necessarily say what will help my child

or your child or any individual child in

the end each of our children is going to

walk their own

and that's partly defined by the genes

they inherit and of course all the

experiences they have through their

lives including their interactions with

us their parents I will tell you what I

did after I learnt all this it's a bit

embarrassing I realized I was so busy

working and ironically learning and

writing about this incredible study of

British children that there were days

when I hardly even spoke to my own

British children so at home we

introduced talking time which is just 15

minutes at the end of the day when we

talk and listen to the boys I try better

now to ask them what they did today and

to show that I value what they do at

school of course I make sure they always

have a book to read I tell them that I'm

ambitious for their future and I think

they can be happy and do great things I

don't know that any of that will make a

difference but I'm pretty confident it

won't do them any harm and it might even

do them some good ultimately if we want

happy children all we can do is listen

to the science and of course listen to

our children themselves thank you
